This directory, at ./drupal/starter-data on the host and on /starter-data on
the Drupal container, contains a starter database as well as some starter files
such as images. This is useful for new users or automated test environments.

If you update the data on your local environment and would like the starter
data to reflect this, use ./scripts/update-starter-data.sh
